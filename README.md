# AllstateClaimsSeverity-
For my final project in Predictive Analysis (Stat 348) I was assigned the "Allstate Claims Severity" Kaggle Competition. I had to explore the data, develop feature engineering, and build at least 3 predicitive models to predict the severity of different claims. The models I choose to use were Random Forests, Boosted Trees, and BART. Boosted Trees using the lightgbm engine performed the best. The metric used to assess model performance was mean absolute error (mae). The following link is my public Kaggle notebook with description of the problem and my model.
